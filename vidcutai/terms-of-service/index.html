<p>Here’s the revised sections with your considerations in mind:</p>
<h3 id="8-data-security-and-confidentiality">8. <strong>Data Security and Confidentiality</strong></h3>
<p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement a variety of industry-standard measures to protect it. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to encrypt data during transmission, ensuring that your information is secure while being transferred over the internet. Additionally, we employ secure methods for communication between our servers to safeguard your data. While we make every effort to protect your information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<p>We retain user-generated content, such as audio files and transcripts, for as long as necessary to provide and improve the Service. Specifically, only MP3 audio files are uploaded to our servers and are deleted after processing. The processed content, such as text transcripts, will be retained both for your ongoing access and for potential internal use, including but not limited to model training and service improvements. You may request the deletion of your transcripts at any time by contacting us. However, please note that certain data may still be retained for internal purposes, legal obligations, or to enhance the quality of our services.</p>

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, with or without notice, at any time, especially during our beta phase.</p>
